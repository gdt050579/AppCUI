AppCUI development
===================

Github workflows
-----------------

Github workflows will be automatically triggered on push to ``main`` and on ``pull_request``.

If any workflows need to be triggered for other branches, one could create a draft PR to start testing or manually trigger the workflows from the `Actions` page, while selecting the required workflow. 
The contributor will be greeted with a ``This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger`` and a ``Run workflow`` button.
